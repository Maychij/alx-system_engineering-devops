User Accessing the Website: Imagine a user sitting at their computer and typing "www.foobar.com" into their web browser's address bar, indicating their desire to access your website.

Server: A server is a computer system that responds to requests made by other computers, known as clients. In this scenario, we'll have one server that hosts all components of our web infrastructure.

Domain Name (www.foobar.com): The domain name serves as the human-readable address for accessing websites. In our case, "www.foobar.com" is the domain name through which users will access our website.

DNS Record: The DNS (Domain Name System) is responsible for translating domain names like "www.foobar.com" into IP addresses like "8.8.8.8". The DNS record associated with "www.foobar.com" needs to be configured to point to our server's IP address (8.8.8.8).

Web Server (Nginx): The web server's role is to handle incoming HTTP requests from clients (users' web browsers) and serve the appropriate content. Nginx will be responsible for this task in our infrastructure.

Application Server: The application server hosts the backend logic of our website. It processes requests, executes code, interacts with the database, and generates dynamic content. For this task, we'll have a separate application server.

Application Files: These are the files containing the codebase of our website. They include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side scripts (e.g., PHP), and any other necessary files to run our application.

Database (MySQL): The database stores and manages the website's data. MySQL will be used as our relational database management system (RDBMS) to store and retrieve data related to our website.

Communication with User's Computer: When a user requests a website, their computer sends an HTTP request to the server over the internet. The server responds by sending back the requested web pages, which are then rendered by the user's web browser.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Since all components are hosted on a single server, if the server goes down for any reason, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

Downtime during Maintenance: Performing maintenance tasks such as deploying new code or updating server configurations may require restarting the web server. During this time, the website will be inaccessible to users.

Limited Scalability: With only one server handling all incoming traffic, the infrastructure may struggle to handle a large influx of visitors. Scaling up to accommodate increased traffic may not be feasible without adding more servers or upgrading hardware.
